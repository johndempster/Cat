        DLLs and DPLs the application requires).

     2. Components and design-time packages.

     3. The Borland Database Engine (BDE).

     4. ActiveX controls (OCXs).

     5. Sample Images.

     6. Local InterBase and multi-user InterBase Server.

     7. Multi-tiered Distributed Application Services (MIDAS).

     8. IntraBuilder trial version applications.

     9. C++Builder trial version applications.

     10. SQL Links support for remote server access.

     11. The Visual Query Builder.

     12. Fractal Image Format (FIF) software.

     13. JPEG compression software.

     14. Data compression library (zlib).

     15. ReportSmith.

     16. Removed or modified "Redistributable" files.

It is recommended that you use InstallShield Express, or another
Borland-certified install program, to deploy your applications.


=======================================================================


1. Application deployment (all applications)
--------------------------------------------
Delphi applications do not require a runtime interpreter DLL. All you
have to provide is your .EXE file and any DLLs or DPLs that it calls.
For simple applications you can distribute a standalone .EXE file. If
you have used runtime packages with your application, be sure to
include all required DPLs with the distribution. For applications
that use the Borland Database Engine, you must use a Borland-certified
installation/deployment utility, such as InstallShield Express.

If you use InstallShield, treat .DPL (package) files just like other
DLLs. From the Setup Checklist, open Groups and Files, then click
Add Group. You can create a group called "Packages" for DPLs; to
install packages in the Windows\System directory, choose <WINSYSDIR>
as the destination directory. (We recommend installing .DLL and .DPL
files in the Windows\System directory.) Then click Launch Explorer
to select the DPL files you want to deploy.

NOTE: When you deploy applications that use the TCoolBar component,
make sure that end-users have version 4.70 or later of COMCTL32.DLL.
Setting the Flat property of TToolBar to True also requires version
4.70 or later of COMCTL32.DLL. For a list of other components that
work best with the latest version of COMCTL32.DLL, see README.TXT.

TREGSVR.EXE is fully redistributable.

The Internet Control Pack included with Delphi is copyrighted by
NetManage and is fully redistributable.


2. Components, design-time packages, and runtime packages
---------------------------------------------------------
If you distribute Delphi packages to other developers, be sure to
supply both .DCP and .DPL files. You will probably also want to
include .DCU files as well as documentation. Package Collection (.DPC)
files, created with the Package Collection Editor, offer a convenient
way to distribute all the files associated with a package or group of
packages.

In accordance with the General Terms That Apply to Compiled Programs
and Redistributables, you may redistribute Borland-supplied runtime
packages only for the purpose of executing application programs
created with Delphi. You may not modify these packages in any way.

  If you are a licensed user of Delphi Client/Server, redistributable
  runtime packages include the following:

   DSS30.DPL
   IBEVNT30.DPL
   INET30.DPL
   INETDB30.DPL
   QRPT30.DPL
   TEE30.DPL
   TEEDB30.DPL
   TEEUI30.DPL
   VCL30.DPL
   VCLDB30.DPL
   VCLDBX30.DPL
   VCLSMP30.DPL
   VCLX30.DPL

  If you are a licensed user of Delphi Professional, redistributable
  runtime packages include the following:

   IBEVNT30.DPL
   QRPT30.DPL
   TEE30.DPL
   TEEDB30.DPL
   TEEUI30.DPL
   VCL30.DPL
   VCLDB30.DPL
   VCLDBX30.DPL
   VCLSMP30.DPL
   VCLX30.DPL

  If you are a licensed user of Delphi Standard, redistributable
  runtime packages include the following:

   QRPT30.DPL
   VCL30.DPL
   VCLDB30.DPL
   VCLDBX30.DPL
   VCLSMP30.DPL
   VCLX30.DPL

Although this software may include packages other than those
listed above, only the packages listed above are redistributable.

You may NOT redeploy Borland-supplied design-time-only packages.

You may not recompile or redistribute any Borland-supplied
components or libraries for use by other developers.

Packages that you develop may not have the same names as
Borland-supplied packages. If you distribute component libraries
or other packages, it is recommended that you avoid using the default
DCLUSR30 package name, since this will cause naming conflicts with
other developers.


3. BDE deployment (all database applications)
---------------------------------------------

    Borland Database Engine (BDE) redistributable files
    ---------------------------------------------------
    In accordance with the Additional License Terms for Borland
    Database Engine, you may distribute the Borland Database Engine
    files with your application using a Borland-certified
    Redistributable Install program such as InstallShield Express or
    another compliant install program. You may redistribute only those
    BDE files selected by the Borland-certified install program.

    Delphi 3 includes InstallShield Express, a certified install
    program that facilitates proper installation and un-installation of
    Delphi applications. InstallShield Express helps ensure that your
    applications co-exist well with other software that uses the
    BDE, such as dBASE, Paradox, and C++. InstallShield Express also
    makes it easy to distribute subsets of the Borland Database Engine;
    this is useful, for example, if you want to distribute an
    application that uses only dBASE tables, and you don't want to
    include additional files for Paradox support.

    NOTE: InstallShield Express installs the MS Access driver with the
    ODBC driver. To deploy Access applications, select the ODBC driver
    in InstallShield. The Access driver requires installation of the
    JET engine (DAO 3.0) on the computer where it is deployed.

    NOTE: Do not deploy DB-Lib and CT-Lib with the same application.
    DB-Lib is for Sybase 4.2 or lower, and CT-Lib is for Sybase
    System 10 and higher.

    From time to time, Borland may, at its discretion, certify
    additional installation programs for use as a Borland Certified
    Install Program for this product. You should visit Borland's
    Web site (http://www.borland.com/) for the latest information,
    including the current list (CERTINST.DOC) of Borland Certified
    Install programs (if any) for this product.

    Deployment of Borland Database Engine files and subsets must be
    done with a Borland Certified Install Program. We do not otherwise
    allow deployment of the individual BDE files. There are several
    important reasons for this:

      o Improper installation of the BDE or BDE subsets can cause other
        applications using the BDE to fail. Such applications include
        not only Borland products, but many other programs that use
        the BDE, such as those built with Borland C++ and Delphi.

      o Windows 95 and Windows NT now have stringent un-install 
        requirements for MS logo certification.  Un-installation of 
        BDE components is especially complex, and if not done 
        correctly will violate logo requirements and can cause 
        applications to fail.

      o Windows 95 and Windows NT use the registry instead of .INI 
        files, and making the correct entries and deletions for 
        install and un-install is also a complex task.

    By working closely with Borland Certified Install Program
    providers, we can ensure that all the installation, registry,
    and un-install tasks are handled correctly.


4. ActiveX controls (OCXs)
--------------------------
Delphi 3 includes ActiveX Controls (OCXs) for use in your applications:

  o Chart FX, copyright SoftwareFX Inc.

  o VisualSpeller Control, copyright Visual Components, Inc.

  o Formula One (spreadsheet), copyright Visual Components, Inc.

  o First Impression (VtChart), copyright Visual Components, Inc.

  o Graph Custom Control, copyright Bits Per Second Ltd.

The version of each of these OCXs shipped with Delphi may be 
redistributed in custom Delphi applications. Such redistribution 
is subject to the General Terms That Apply to Compiled Programs and
Redistributables.


5. Sample images
----------------
Delphi 3 includes a library of redistributable bitmap images
normally installed in the subdirectory \IMAGES.

Delphi 3 also includes a database EVENTS.DB with licensed
images from PhotoDisc. The images in this database are copyright
PhotoDisc, Inc. 1995 and may not be redistributed.


6. Local InterBase and multi-user InterBase Server deployment
-------------------------------------------------------------

    Applications that use the 32-bit Local InterBase
    ------------------------------------------------
    Delphi Client/Server and Delphi Professional include a development
    license for Local InterBase. They do not, however, include rights
    for deployment or redistribution of any InterBase component. To
    deploy InterBase applications, you must purchase Deployment Kits;
    contact Borland at 1-800-457-9527 for details.

    Applications that use the 32-bit four-user InterBase Server
    -----------------------------------------------------------
    Delphi Client/Server contains the 32-bit four-user InterBase
    Server for Windows 95. (This server also runs under Windows NT.)
    Purchase of Delphi Client/Server, however, does not include
    deployment or redistribution rights for any InterBase Server
    files. Customers who wish to deploy InterBase Server
    applications must separately purchase individual copies of the
    InterBase Server; contact Borland at 1-800-457-9527 for details.

    Applications that use the 16-bit Local InterBase
    ------------------------------------------------
    Delphi Client/Server is shipped with the 16-bit version of Delphi
    1.0, which includes a copy of the 16-bit Local InterBase and
    deployment rights for that software. For information about
    deployment of the 16-bit Local InterBase, refer to Section 4b
    of the DEPLOY.TXT file for Delphi 1.0.


7. Multi-tiered Distributed Application Services
------------------------------------------------
Delphi Client/Server includes a development license for the
Multi-tiered Distributed Application Services Suite (MIDAS).
MIDAS comprises the Business ObjectBroker, OLEnterprise,
the Remote DataBroker, and the ConstraintBroker Manager
(SQL Explorer). Purchase of Delphi Client/Server, however,
does not include deployment rights for this software.
Customers who wish to deploy applications that use MIDAS
must purchase a separate license for each server on which
MIDAS is installed.

A server deployment license is not required for deploying 
IDPROV32.DLL or DBCLIENT.DLL in an application in which the
client and server reside on the same machine. These two
files are the Client Dataset Redistributables referred to
in the License Statement.

For more information, see Borland's World Wide Web site
(http://www.borland.com/midas/) or contact your local Borland
sales office. For a list of files and components in MIDAS, see
http://www.borland.com/midas/papers/components.html.


8. IntraBuilder trial version applications
------------------------------------------
The Delphi CD includes a trial version of the IntraBuilder Web
application development tool. Purchase of Delphi, however, does
not include distribution rights for applications developed with
IntraBuilder. If you wish to deploy IntraBuilder applications,
you must purchase a separate license. Contact your local
Borland sales office for details.


9. C++Builder trial version applications
----------------------------------------
The Delphi CD includes a trial version of C++Builder, Borland's
rapid application development tool for C++. Purchase of Delphi,
however, does not include distribution rights for applications
developed with C++Builder. If you wish to deploy C++Builder
applications, you must purchase a separate license. Contact
your local Borland sales office for details.


10. SQL Links deployment (client/server applications)
-----------------------------------------------------
When deploying an application that uses SQL Links for Interbase,
you must install MSVCRT.DLL in the Windows system directory of
the target machine.

In addition to the SQL Links files, client/server applications
require client files for interface to communication protocols
such as TCP/IP. Refer to your server documentation.

    Redistributables for SQL Link Software
    --------------------------------------
    Licensed, registered users of Delphi Client/Server may redistribute
    the files listed below ("SQL Link Software Redistributables") with
    programs created using this product, subject to all of the terms
    and conditions of the Additional License Terms for Borland Database
    Engine. The SQL Link Software Redistributables may be redistributed
    only for the purpose of executing end-user SQL Link Software
    applications created with Delphi Client/Server. Although SQL Link
    Software applications developed with Delphi Client/Server may be
    redistributed to an unlimited number of servers for end-users, you
    may not redistribute or otherwise share the SQL Link Software with
    other developers for creating SQL Link Software applications.

    THE SQL LINK SOFTWARE REDISTRIBUTABLES CONTAINED IN THIS PRODUCT
    MAY NOT BE USED BY ANYONE OTHER THAN THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS THE
    LICENSED USER (OR "NAMED USER", IN THE CASE OF AN ENTITY) FOR
